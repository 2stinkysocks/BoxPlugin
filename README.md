# BoxPlugin

#### A plugin written by 2stinkysocks that controls many major features on `aetherconcquest.net`

Requires `su.nightexpress:excellentcrates`, `su.nexmedia:engine`, and `io.lumine:mythic` to be installed to the local maven repo

Also requires buildtools for `v1.19_R1`

Please excuse the messy code, I tried to make it at least somewhat manageable, but it got out of hand quickly. I never expected the project to get so big
